Excelsior is a program that gives an unique oppourtunities for high school students. They stay at high school for 4-6 years
and have mentors assigned to them to assist them in their work. Excelsior students also have the oppourtunity to get an associate's degree.
In their third year of coding, students have the chance to work as a <b> paid </b> intern for IBM. This program puts me at a serious advantage
over those who don't have access to this oppourtunity</body>
