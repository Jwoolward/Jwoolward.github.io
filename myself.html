<body> My name is Joshua Woolward. I am a student in Excelsior Academy and currently in my second year. I am a middle child, with one brother
  and one sister. I consider myself  more accomplished than the average teen, as I play 3 instruments and am currently taking college classes.
  Excelsior has given me a chance to go above and beyond what normal people get to do with their lives. </body>
