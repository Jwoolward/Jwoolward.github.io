<p> <u> Booker T. Washington </u></p>


Booker T. Washington was one of the most influential black leaders of his time period. According to biography.com, Washington was born on April 5th,1856 in Hale’s Ford, Virginia(p1). As a child, he was raised as a slave with his mother Jane. According to biography.com, Washington’s father was a white man who lived in a farm not too far away and most likely either had raped or had an affair with his mother. Washington’s father took no responsibility for him or his mother. Washington was forced to drag around 100 pound bags back and forth from the plantations mill and was forbidden from being educated. The harsh life as a  poor slave kept him from evolving as a human being, and it might have stayed that way had the civil war not ended in the Union’s favor.
When the war ended, Washington’s mother remarried and  took him to Malden, West Virginia, to work in the mines with his new stepfather.  His new stepfather decided to take him to school,where Booker invented his last name due to the fact that the rest of the class answered back with two names. Later in life, when Washington discovered that his mother had a last name, he changed his name to Booker T. Washington. Due to Washington’s education, he was able to attain a successful career as an author, an African American educator, and a leader.  According to Louis R. Harlan, “ After a secondary education at Hampton Institute, he taught an upgraded school and experimented briefly with the study of law and the ministry, but a teaching position at Hampton decided his future career. In 1881 he founded Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute on the Hampton model in the Black Belt of Alabama.” After founding the
										Woolward 2
Tuskegee Institute, Washington went on to give his “Atlanta Compromise” speech, in where he encouraged fellow blacks to give up the fight for civil rights and instead work on improving local crafts and skills in order to put themselves on a higher economic class.
Washington’s speech pleased both northern and southern whites so much that they made him a spokesman, which gained him fame and power over the media. However, black intellectuals as W. E. B. Du Bois, John Hope, and William Monroe Trotter saw him as a traitor for trying to convince other Negroes to give up the fight for civil rights. Washington continued to write articles in the news about the progress the Negro race was making. According to Booker T. Washington in an article titled “Negro self help” , ” The public has [not] been sufficiently informed of what the Negro himself has been doing ... toward his own education…”. On another newspaper, Booker T. Washington in an article titled ”solving the race problem” said ,”It is the race or individual that exercises the most patience, forbearance and self-control...that wins its course and respect.”
Although Washington was non confrontational, he secretly blocked southern attempts to enforce segregation and prevent blacks from obtaining citizenship for the rest of his life. Washington married 3 times, losing his first 2 wives to death and marrying Margaret Murray Washington in 1893. According to Biography.com, Washington died on November 14, 1915. An article he was working on was published a month after his death, dealing with segregation laws. According to Booker T. Washington in the article ”My View of Segregation Laws”, "... no individual and no race can succeed which sets itself at war against the common good; for "in the gain or loss of one race, all the rest have equal claim”.
In conclusion, Booker T. Washington was very proficient  in many categories. He was an author, a  writer, a  civil rights activist, and an African American educator. He was very

inspirational in the types of articles he would write, which gave him respect among his fellow African Americans. Washington was given many different memorials, including a national monument located near Virginia.
